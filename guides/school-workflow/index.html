Joplin
Joplin doesn&rsquo;t have a native PDF viewer. I had to use MasterPDF Editor which is covered below. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d structure Joplin like the figure below, and it worked just fine for organization and regular typing&mdash;until it didn&rsquo;t. I wanted to use either pure MarkDown, or Rich text. Though, Joplin has a button problem and any time a user would click the Rich Text button after writing everything in MarkDown, it&rsquo;d break your beautiful MD formatting. The solution was to switch from Viewer mode to Edit mode, while disabling Rich Text Editor mode. Another annoying hiccup was that MarkDown view didn&rsquo;t have PDF preview where one could scroll through the PDF, make annotations, or anything. So, I&rsquo;d find myself clicking between the MD Editor and MD Viewer panes frequently&mdash;the side-by-side view is hideous. I got rid of Joplin, and imported all of my files to Zotero in a /University/* section.">

<p>Below I will cover Joplin, MasterPDF Editor Free, LatTeX and Lyx, LibreOffice Writer, Stationary, Calendar, Contacts, and finally Email.</p>
<h3 id="joplin">Joplin</h3>
<p>Joplin doesn&rsquo;t have a native PDF viewer. I had to use MasterPDF Editor which is covered below. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d structure Joplin like the figure below, and it worked just fine for organization and regular typing&mdash;until it didn&rsquo;t. I wanted to use either pure MarkDown, or Rich text.

Another annoying hiccup was that MarkDown view didn&rsquo;t have PDF preview where one could scroll through the PDF, make annotations, or anything. So, I&rsquo;d find myself clicking between the MD Editor and MD Viewer panes frequently&mdash;the side-by-side view is hideous. I got rid of Joplin, and imported all of my files to Zotero in a <code>/University/*</code> section.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>University/

</code></pre><h3 id="masterpdf-editor-free">MasterPDF Editor Free</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d use this in tandem with Joplin. I&rsquo;d open PDF documents that I needed to edit (e.g. typing lecture notes down). It worked well, it was free, and I still use it. One cool feature is that it will always make an automatic backup of your PDF within your directory.</p>
<h3 id="latex-lyx">LaTeX, LyX</h3>
<p>I used this for typesetting essays, and I wish I learned to use it sooner. I&rsquo;ll continue using it.</p>
<h3 id="libreoffice">LibreOffice</h3>
<p>I used this for a bit, taking bullet point notes. I found it very clunky for studying as I&rsquo;d either have multiple windows of LibreOffice Writer opened, or I&rsquo;d be compiling enormous <code>.odt</code> documents.</p>
<h3 id="stationary">Stationary</h3>
<p>Paper: I used 90gsm printer paper for laser jets. If you go to Staples, it&rsquo;s the second thickest pages you can get&mdash;they&rsquo;re in the pink wrapper.</p>
<p>Portfolio: The cover was a folding plastic pretending-to-be-leather portfolio. I only loved it for the paper holder clasp. It kept the papers very still.</p>

<p>Ink: Kaweco, or <a href="https://mountainofink.com/blog/colorverse-sm1">Colorverse 84 (SM-1) and 85 (Costar)</a>.</p>
<h3 id="calendar-contacts-email">Calendar, Contacts, Email</h3>
<p>I used Baikal for my contacts and calendar, and it&rsquo;s self-hosted on my server. For email, I used my Protonmail, and school email addresses in <a href="https://www.betterbird.eu/">Betterbird</a>. I&rsquo;ve had zero problems with any of the software. By extension, my phone used DAVx^5 for calendar and contact syncing&mdash;the information is also available on my laptop and desktop</p>
<h2 id="md">MD</h2>
<p>I know, I know, I <em>have</em> to use Anki&mdash;and I will. Actually, I gave Anki a test-run in my 3000&ndash;level year and it performed so much better than I thought it would. I&rsquo;ll say this happened in <em>Genes, Brain, and Behaviour.</em> When I began the course, I was feeling normal, but as the weeks rounded past the first month, we had midterms. Brainfog hit me in the middle of my exam, and I had it for a few days prior, too. I bombed the midterm, and I think I scored somewhere between 50% and 60%. This blew a hole in my confidence, and while I was balancing other courses, I needed to solve two problems: 1) figure out how to fix this brain fog before it&rsquo;s too late; 2) get a high score on the next test to balance things out.</p>
<p>The brain fog question wasn&rsquo;t too hard to answer, and that&rsquo;s because the research was already published: <a href="https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/potential-new-treatment-for-brain-fog-in-long-covid-patients/"><em>The Potential New Treatment for &ldquo;Brain Fog&rdquo; in Long COVID Patients, 2022, Yale SoM.</em></a> I read some other studies about neuroinflammation, NAC, COVID, and so on. After research gathering, I spoke to my pharmacist about taking the OTC treatment and I was told that it&rsquo;d be no problem. So, I started taking NAC, and it felt as if a heavy wool blanket was lifted from my head, and I could take a cool breath of fresh air. Then, I turned to learning Anki.</p>
<p>Put simply, Anki helped me get a high-enough score to finish the course with an A-minus, but it took a lot of energy, and effort to ride the learning curve, while also learning new content. I used cloze and image occlusion for all of the slides, as this wasn&rsquo;t a textbook+lecture+slides class, it was just a slides+lecture class, which I strongly prefer. It helps distill, and make easy to see what is testable. I find textbooks are far too broad, and with that generality in addition to time-constraints, people often hate the burden of three-figure length readings per week. I know I did. So, in medical school, I&rsquo;ll be using Anki plus another few additions. First, though, let&rsquo;s start with the new additions beause Anki is at the end of the river.</p>
<h3 id="zotero">Zotero</h3>
<p>Zotero is a well-known research assistant, that some people use with AI (more below). However, my to-be-used workflow looks like this:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Structure Zotero to agree with the names of courses that I&rsquo;ll be taking in school.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Put in school files (syllabus, text, schedule, etc.) when available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annotate, highlight, and perform other manipulations in Zotero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Export annotations to a note, and then copy/paste into Anki to make cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Record any accessory notes that aren&rsquo;t related to Anki-style studying in the <a href="https://github.com/windingwind/zotero-better-notes">Zotero Better Notes plugin.</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>I thought about using A.I. to enhance my studying, and though I&rsquo;ve criticized A.I. in an essay on this website, I wanted to see its capabilities. I downloaded <a href="https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui">OpenWeb UI</a>, and hated it. The sole factor I was investigating was if I could use RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) to help me synthesize points from documents that I need to use for school. On one hand, I didn&rsquo;t know if I was allowed to do this because of copyright, and other legal issues. My model(s) used in testing were all entirely offline, and open-source (<a href="https://ollama.com/">ollama</a>). Though, I did think that &ldquo;If I am allowed to use this open-source program, and I am using a copy of a book that <strong>I</strong> own, how is it any different from me putting it in Anki?&rdquo; That answer wouldn&rsquo;t have to be answered after I tested RAG with a a 40gb corpus from my personal Zotero library.</p>
<p>It performed horribly&mdash;I scratched the project entirely. Also, anything that was to be directly used with Zotero (i.e. the plugins), the developers always chose to call the OpenAI API, or other paid-provider.</p>
<h3 id="anki">Anki</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ll use Anki as I did in undergrad, but it&rsquo;ll be supplemented with Zotero.</p>
<h3 id="laptop">Laptop</h3>
<p>I retired my Dell XPS-13 from undergrad, and gifted it to someone without a laptop. Of course, I put <a href="https://archlinux.org/">Arch Linux</a> on it for them, too.</p>
<p>My new laptop is a <a href="https://frame.work/ca/en/laptop16">Framework 16&quot;</a> and it&rsquo;s been wonderful so far. I could go into the build (that I assembled myself), but that&rsquo;s needless.</p>
<h3 id="dual-monitor">Dual Monitor</h3>
<p>My dual-monitor set up, that I had throughout undergrad, was upgraded. I now have two 27&quot; (monster) monitors, that are at 1080p. People may scoff at such a low resolution, when 2k, and 4k exist; however, 1080p is just fine and they were on sale. Plus I wanted large screens for reading ease. I sometimes find myself leaning forward to read, but this is a part of my comfort journey with my desk setup. The dual monitors are shared between my desktop and laptop.</p>
<h3 id="kvm-switch">KVM Switch</h3>
<p>I got a KVM which connects my dual monitors to my desktop (plus a data cable), and my laptop. The beauty is that I can turn on and plugin in my laptop, connect the USB-C to dual-HDMI output cable, and use my desktop keyboard and mouse. This saves me such a huge syncing headache. Before, I had Joplin synced between my desktop (where I&rsquo;d work on things mostly), and my laptop (that&rsquo;d I&rsquo;d bring to school), and phone (for personal notes). I hated it&mdash;so many replicas of a software I hated. Now the laptop set up is far easier to manage.</p>
<h3 id="data-back-ups">Data Back Ups</h3>
<p>Backing up data is the final piece of the puzzle. I have server storage as shown below for backups, and other data storage. Of course, it&rsquo;s all locked up with <code>LUKS</code>.</p>

</code></pre><p>If you&rsquo;re curious, here&rsquo;s my backup script that I use for my operating system(s), from OS drive to external HDD.</p>
<p>Also, note how I kill zotero before I begin the backup. A constantly open database needs to be stopped before it can sync&mdash;otherwise corruption is a risk.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#! /bin/bash
killall -s SIGTERM zotero-bin;
sudo rsync -aAXH --delete --info=progress2 --stats --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/run/* --exclude=/mnt/* --exclude=/media/* --exclude=&#34;swapfile&#34; --exclude=&#34;lost+found&#34; --exclude=&#34;.cache&#34; --exclude=&#34;Downloads&#34; --exclude=&#34;.VirtualBoxVMs&#34;--exclude=&#34;.ecryptfs&#34; / /mnt/backup/Desktop-OS \
&amp;&amp; echo &#34;The OS drive has been backed up.&#34;
</code></pre><p>Then, <em>that</em> backup is sent to the server</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>#! /bin/bash

sudo rsync -aAXH -e &#39;ssh -i /home/user/.ssh/user -p 1111&#39; --delete --progress --stats --exclude=/dev/* --exclude=/proc/* --exclude=/sys/* --exclude=/tmp/* --exclude=/run/* --exclude=/mnt/backup/* --exclude=/mnt/Android/* --exclude=/media/* --exclude=&#34;swapfile&#34; --exclude=&#34;lost+found&#34; --exclude=&#34;.cache&#34; --exclude=&#34;Downloads&#34; --exclude=&#34;.VirtualBoxVMs&#34;--exclude=&#34;.ecryptfs&#34; /mnt/backup/* root@192.168.0.4:/mnt/backup/Desktop-Everything \
&amp;&amp; echo &#34;The Operating System, and the SSD, stored on the external HDD has\
been backed up to the server.&#34;
</code></pre><p>Great! Now everything is backed up from everywhere, and onto a single place: plus redundancy!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the final word regarding my school workflow.</p>
