<h1 id="editing-projects">Editing Projects</h1>
<p class="description"> 
These projects are based around text-editing in its many forms: copy-editing, proof-reading, substantive editing, and so on.
</p>
<br>
<h2 id="new-typeset-hymnal">New Typeset Hymnal</h2>
<p><strong>The Old and New:</strong> In 2024, the choir I attend compiled a booklet for praying, chanting, and singing. Though the efforts
were useful, and practical; the presentation left much to be desired. After our first use of this homemade hymnal,
some in the choir brought up well-founded complaints. Legability, and text-flow were some of those voiced. At Dalhousie,
I studided under Allison LaSorda, in the English department Editing and Publishing class. While there, I learned some
basic editing and publishing skills, but, since that 2023 class, I taught myself how to typeset. Though the project is
nearly finished, I&rsquo;ve decided to upload a before-and-after sample of the work done. The new typeset took many hours to
complete. Please, see the new and old sample <a href="/projects/hymnal">by clicking this link</a></p>
<h2 id="high-fantasy-editing">High Fantasy Editing</h2>
<p><strong>An Interesting Lunch:</strong> We all were looking for some easy conversation as we had just left the grave yard where we completed a committal in the cold early Spring air. Over each of our warm meals, we shared equally warm words about stories of past, present, and fantasy. One friend of mine, who caught me off-guard with his writing practice, began telling us, bashfully, of his years long project. His more than one-hundred-thousand word book piqued my interest, and I decided to offer him my edits. Though I cannot, and would not, post examples of my in-line, and margin notes that encouraged polishing of what beautiful marble was already formed. I do wish to share that these long chapters were a pleasure to read, write upon, and happily return.</p>
<h2 id="celta-course-assignment-editing">Celta: Course Assignment Editing</h2>
<p><strong>Actualizing a Vision:</strong> Fergus has been a friend of mine for several years. Like the example above, when I get together with people, though our conversations are rich, we often fall upon writing and editing topics. Mr. Fadden told me of a side-project of his: a work that he has been growing for many years. However, he did wish to test my writing mettle through a favour. I obliged his request and helped him edit, and organize his course assignments and general outlines: <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/kajabi-storefronts-production/file-uploads/sites/2148438810/themes/2161527829/downloads/e4cd66-f026-bc22-5546-27243781462_1_2025_ISA_CELTA_Assignment_Book_1_Guide_to_Passing_the_CELTA_Assignments.pdf%22">a sample can be found here.</a> Since we&rsquo;ve finished this project he asked me to help in other areas. Slowly, we are working on rebuilding his website to attract more students. I am quite happy that he is brave enough, and has the fortitude to follow his deep desires.</p>

<p class="description"> 
As a long-term hobby, I love to write poetry and prose. I have one large project that I aim to publish. However, my other 
projects are offline, and meant for me alone.
</p>
<p><strong>Prose:</strong> I&rsquo;ve been writing prose for many years, and I have one large work, in prose, that is close to completion. <a href="/projects/prose">A sample can be found here</a></p>
<br>
<p><strong>Poetry:</strong> Like unto the prose section above, I have <a href="/poetry.html">a sample that can be found here</a></p>

<h1 id="research-projects">Research Projects</h1>
<p class="description"> 
I don't see myself as doing bench-style research, as I prefer regular, and diverse, human contact in a clinical setting. 
However, when I see a knowledge gap during my online explorations of open-source journal articles, I experience some 
strong drive to fulfill my curiousity. One such subject is <em> Online Extremism </em>.
</p>
<br>
<h2 id="online-extremism">Online Extremism</h2>
<center style="color:white;">You can view some project teasers <a href="/projects/ethnography/4chan">here.</a> </center>
<p><strong>Background:</strong> One constantly growing area of worry remains among all levels of society: public, private,
academic, and government. With the ever-changing digital landscape allowing people to stay hidden (cryptography), remain
online (federation), and resistant to take-downs, there is cause for concern among online extremism. Frankly, there are
not enough resources to appropriately address the looming, disaffected, crowd of deep, and/or dark-web users.
<br>
<strong>Aim:</strong> However, one approach to this problem would be using data-science to determine fluctuations of high-risk actors, while crossing
their online text, with real-world events. This has a few implications. First, by studying the psychology of online
extremism, clinicians can develop models of de-escalation for these small populations. Secondly, clinicians will have
new tools available for use in identifying individuals who struggle to enact healthy, pro-social, and non-violent means
of frustrated expression.
<br>
<strong>Goals:</strong> My project, written in <em>R</em>, uses over 1 billion rows of data, each containing large numbers of words, so that
profiles of semantics, <em>n-</em>gram context, and relevant topics (by year(s)) can be used for meeting the aims of the
above paragraph.

<h2 id="computer-projects">Computer Projects</h2>
<p class="description"> 
In this section, I go over the various technology projects that I've contributed a substantial amount of time towards.
This has been a very rewarding practice that I hope to bring into clinical medicine.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="desktop-and-laptop">Desktop, and Laptop</h2>
<p><strong>Starting in 2020,</strong> I moved away form using Mac and Windows operating systems. Since then, I&rsquo;ve exclusively been using Linux, a Free and Open-Source (FOSS) operating system.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="mobile-device">Mobile Device</h2>
<p><strong>Agreeable to FOSS philosophies,</strong> I also run <a href="https://grapheneos.org/">Graphene OS</a> on my smart phone. The developers who made this operating system value privacy. Considering patient care, I can see where they come from. I learned that companies like Google, or Apple, do not respect the privary of their customers.  <a href="/projects/privacy-invasion/">Some examples can be found on this webpage</a></p>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="server">Server</h2>
<p><strong>I saw the need to control</strong> technology in my life. I used to play video games as a hobby. As I grew older, I felt that I was wasting my time. After I learned how to use Linux at a beginner level, I decided to retire my desktop computer that I used to play video games, and I then turned it into a remote storage server! This project allowed me to be independent of subscriptions, and it costs me only dollars in power every year, plus it runs on cheap storage disks that can last over a decade!</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="technology-use-in--medical-care">Technology Use in <br> Medical Care</h2>
<p><strong>I strong support patient privacy, and advocacy.</strong> By owning, and operating, a family clinic, I will have a two-fold means of supporting my patients. I will host my own software, on my own hardware, at my own office, and backed up at my own home. Secondly, I have made privacy practices an integral part of my life, and I will incorporate this into my professional life. Therefore, the ultimate responsibility of patient privacy will remain only with me.</p>
